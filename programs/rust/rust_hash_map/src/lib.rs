//! `HashMap` access patterns over the Talos stdio byte stream.
//!
//! Every export reads one [borsh](https://borsh.io/) value from standard
//! input, applies one map operation, and writes one borsh value back. The
//! interface is functional: an export that changes the map writes the changed
//! map, and an export that also produces a value writes the value beside it.
//! An export that only observes writes the observation alone. Tuple inputs
//! carry the scalars first: a borsh tuple has no framing, and fixed-width
//! leading fields let the reader split at byte four and byte eight.
//!
//! Borsh gives a map a canonical encoding: a `u32` entry count, then the
//! entries sorted by key. A `HashMap` has no order of its own, so the sort is
//! what gives one map one byte string, and a contract can then name the exact
//! bytes an export writes.
//!
//! The map crosses the wire as a `Vec<(u32, u32)>` rather than through borsh's
//! own `HashMap` impl. Borsh gates that impl behind its `std` feature. The
//! verifier builds the whole workspace in one cargo call, and cargo gives a
//! shared dependency one feature set across every member. A feature here
//! would therefore also change the module that `rust_vec` emits. The bytes
//! are the same either way: borsh's impl sorts the entries by key and writes
//! them through this same `Vec` encoding, and it reads them back as a pair
//! list and collects it. `sorted_entries` and `collect_entries` below are
//! those two steps. The host test `matches_borsh_hash_map_impl` checks both
//! against that impl through a dev-dependency, which the wasm build does not
//! see. Borsh's own reader also rejects keys that do not ascend under the
//! non-default `de_strict_order` feature, which this crate neither enables nor
//! goes through.
//!
//! `borsh::from_slice` rejects trailing bytes, so each export accepts exactly
//! one encoded value and writes nothing otherwise. Empty input is rejected
//! too: borsh encodes an empty map as four zero bytes. Nothing in this crate
//! indexes with `[]`.
//!
//! A panic is not an outcome the contracts allow. This module imports only
//! `stdio.read`, `stdio.write` and `talos.oom`. A panic therefore traps, and
//! that trap is neither a normal return nor the OOM outcome. Three panic
//! paths are new here against `rust_vec`. They are the whole set: the panic
//! messages this module carries and `rust_vec` does not are exactly these
//! three. The rest of the string difference between the two modules is source
//! paths and the export names. The three paragraphs below give the reason each
//! one cannot run.
//!
//! The sort compares `u32` keys under `u32` ordering, which is a total order.
//! The check for a bad comparison function never fires.
//!
//! The default hasher takes its seed from a lazy thread-local. That storage
//! reports an error only during thread teardown. This module runs as one
//! single-shot instance and tears down no thread.
//!
//! `collect_entries` builds the table from a pair list that is already in
//! memory. Each wire pair costs eight bytes, so the input bounds the capacity
//! the table asks for. The bump allocator in `talos_stdio` caps the heap at
//! `MAX_HEAP_END`, which is `isize::MAX`, and raises `talos.oom` at that cap.
//! The capacity therefore stays below the overflow arithmetic in the table.
//! This last argument is stated, not proved: no test reaches the cap, and a
//! test that did would need a two-gigabyte input.
//!
//! A repeated key on the wire is not a rejection. The reader collects a pair
//! list, so the map keeps the last value of a repeated key and can hold fewer
//! entries than the wire count states.
