# Specification for `rust_hash_map`

Five exports, one `HashMap` access pattern each.  The interface is functional:
every export reads one borsh value from standard input, applies one operation,
and writes one borsh value back.  An export that changes the map writes the
changed map, and an export that also produces a value writes the value beside
it.  Each contract is therefore stated against the pure association-list model
in `CodeLib.RustStd.HashMap.Basic` and the layouts in `CodeLib.RustStd.Borsh`
and `CodeLib.RustStd.HashMap.Codec`.

Borsh writes a map as an entry count and then the entries sorted by key, so
the bytes depend only on the content of the map and not on where the hash
function put each key.  That makes the encoding canonical, so the two exports
that write a map back out have exact contracts like the three that write a
scalar.  On the way in, borsh accepts entries in any order and keeps
the last value of a repeated key, so the header count and what `map_len`
writes can differ; `HashMap.ofEntries` is that step in the model.

`borsh::from_slice` rejects trailing bytes, so an input is accepted only when
it is exactly one encoded value.  Every rejection writes nothing.  A `None`
result writes its tag byte `[0]`, so a rejected input and a `None` result stay
distinguishable.  The encode step cannot fail: an allocation failure raises
`talos.oom` rather than an `Err`.

The contracts are partial, not total.  `read_all`, the decoder, and the map
itself all allocate in proportion to the input, so an allocation failure is a
reachable terminal outcome for every one of these exports; the `talos.oom`
host trap is therefore admitted as an alternative to a correct write, in the
shape `Project.Mergesort.Spec` uses.  Fuel, linear memory, and allocator state
stay hidden.

header shorter than four bytes, a payload with a trailing partial pair, or an
entry count that disagrees with the header.  A repeated key keeps its last
value. -/

/-- `map_len`: the entry count as a borsh `u32`; nothing when the input is
rejected.  The map holds at most one entry per wire pair, and the header
already bounds that count below `2 ^ 32`, so the Rust `as u32` cast is
exact. -/

a borsh tuple, which has no framing of its own.  The map goes out in key order
whatever order it came in. -/

without it the three pairs would come back in the order they arrived.

The mirror of this check is `borsh_layout_matches_the_lean_model` in
`programs/rust/rust_hash_map/src/lib.rs`, which asserts the same 29 bytes
against real borsh.  Both sides name the same literal, so the model and the
crate are pinned to each other and not only to themselves.

well-founded recursion, so `decide +kernel` does not reduce it. -/

/-! ## Reading the contracts

Each contract quantifies over raw bytes.  The theorems below read them on
well-formed input, where the round trip of the entry list and
`Borsh.hashMap?_hashMap` turn the byte-level statement into one about the
association-list model.  All five exports have a reader here, so no contract is
stated and then left unapplied.  Together they exercise all three readers
(`mapOf`, `keyAndMap` and `keyValueAndMap`), the decode direction of
`Borsh.u32`, both `Option` tags, the `Borsh.bool` layout, and the map
operations `len`, `insert`, `remove`, `get` and `containsKey`.

The last four go the other way.  They bound the entry count of a decoded map,
show that such a map always has distinct keys whatever bytes arrive, and show
that the map half of what `map_insert` and `map_remove` write reads back as
that map in key order.  The output of one export is therefore well-formed
input to another. -/

and the rest follows unchanged. -/
