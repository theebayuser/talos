# Continuation and Result types

`Continuation` is the outcome of a single instruction or block evaluation:
the interpreter returns one of these at every step and callers pattern-match
on it to decide how to continue. `Result` is the coarser outcome reported to
the caller of `run` — it collapses the in-flight control-flow variants
(`Fallthrough`, `Break`, `Return`) into a single `Success`.
