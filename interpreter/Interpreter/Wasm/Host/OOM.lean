# Terminal out-of-memory host

`talos.oom : () -> ()` is the distinguished terminal notification used by
Talos's tiny Wasm allocator.  The Wasm signature has no result because Wasm
function types do not express non-returning calls; its host implementation and
contract trap on every well-shaped invocation instead.

The boolean marker in `State` makes OOM a typed observable fact in addition to
the stable host-trap message.  Malformed calls trap without setting it, so they
cannot be mistaken for resource exhaustion.
