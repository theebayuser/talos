# The universal host

One host environment offering every host function the interpreter knows about,
so a specification never has to choose a host.

A module is served by `Universal.envFor «module»` whatever it imports: all of
`StdIO`, all of `Random`, some of each, in any order, or nothing at all. The
functions a module does not import are still present in the state and simply
unreachable — no `call` resolves to them.

`Universal.State` is a plain record with one field per host, each defaulted.
Adding a host means adding a field and one `component` term, both here; the host
itself is written in the ordinary way and needs no knowledge that this file
exists. Because every field has a default, existing construction sites keep
compiling, and because the record is what specifications name, existing theorems
keep holding — a bigger state is still the same type constructor.

`envFor_satisfies` needs no hypothesis about the module's imports, which is the
concrete sense in which a proof stops choosing a host: the environment and the
spec are both built by walking `m.imports`, so they agree by construction.

a host later leaves existing construction sites untouched. -/

Each host contributes one `component` term: its own `imports` and `env.funcs`,
and the field it occupies. This is the only file in the repo that knows hosts
get composed at all — a host is written exactly as `Host/StdIO.lean` and
`Host/Random.lean` are, and mentions none of this. -/

traps, and this check says so up front rather than letting the trap masquerade
as program behaviour. -/
