# Name-keyed host registries

`HostEnv.funcs` is *positional*: `funcs[i]` must be the resolver for
`m.imports[i]`, because that is how `call i` finds it. A fixed `HostEnv` value
therefore serves exactly one import list, which is why each host today proves
`env_satisfies` under the hypothesis `m.imports = imports` — the module has to
declare precisely that host's imports, in precisely that order.

A *registry* removes the hypothesis. It is keyed by `ImportDecl` rather than by
position, and builds the positional list on demand, per module, walking that
module's own imports in its own order. Resolution is total: an import no
registered entry claims resolves to a stub that traps, so `envFor` never fails
and a module may declare imports from several hosts at once, in any order.

The payoff is `HostRegistry.envFor_satisfies`: a registry environment satisfies
its own spec for *every* module, with no hypothesis at all. `envFor` and
`specFor` are the same walk over `m.imports`, so they agree by construction.

This generalises `Near.resolveEnv?`, and supplies the "subset/order variant"
that `Near/Proof.lean` notes is missing there.

`Store.mapHost` and `HostFn.lift` let one host's functions run inside a larger
host state — the mechanism behind `Interpreter.Wasm.Host.Universal`.

/-! ## Component lenses

`Store` has one host-dependent field, `host`; the Wasm core never inspects it.
Relabelling it preserves every Wasm-visible resource, which is what lets one
host's functions run inside a composite host state. -/

/-- Replace a store's host state, changing its type. -/
@[inline] def Store.mapHost (f : α → β) (st : Store α) : Store β :=
  { st with host := f st.host }

/-- A view of one component `α` inside a composite host state `β`. The two laws
hold by `rfl` for a record field, which is the only way this is ever built. -/
structure HostLens (β α : Type) where
  get : β → α
  set : β → α → β
  get_set : ∀ whole part, get (set whole part) = part := by intro _ _; rfl
  set_get : ∀ whole, set whole (get whole) = whole := by intro _; rfl

/-- The `α`-view of a composite store. -/
@[inline] def Store.focus (l : HostLens β α) (st : Store β) : Store α :=
  st.mapHost l.get

/-- Paste a component's result store back into the composite one. Wasm-core
fields come from `inner` — a host function may legitimately have written
memory — while the host slot widens `inner`'s component against `outer`. -/

def HostFn.lift (l : HostLens β α) (f : HostFn α) : HostFn β where
  params := f.params

    | .Throw inner tag values => .Throw (Store.unfocus l st.host inner) tag values

/-! A lifted call is the component's call, with the composite host state carried
around it. These three turn a fact about the component into a fact about the
lifted function, which is what a proof under a composite host state needs — and
they let `HostFn.lift` stay out of the `simp` set, where unfolding it would
expand a whole `Store` update at every host call. -/

/-- One registered host import: the declaration a module writes to reach it,
the function behind it, the contract a proof sees, and the fact they agree.

`contract` and `sound` default to the exact contract — "the result is what the
function computes" — which is what every host in the repo uses today, and which
`sound` discharges by `rfl`. A host wanting an implementation-hiding contract
overrides both fields. -/

/-- Pair a host's existing positional import list with its aligned resolvers.

A host already maintains those two lists — `imports` and `env.funcs` — and the
interpreter already relies on them lining up, since that alignment is what makes
`call i` find the right function. `ofImports` reuses exactly that invariant
rather than restating every declaration a second time, so a host's registry is
one line and cannot drift from its imports. -/

the exact contract of the lifted function; a component's own abstract contract
is recovered through its own lemmas, not carried through the lift. -/

/-- Register an existing host as a component of a composite host state: the
host's own `imports` and `env.funcs`, plus the field of the composite state it
occupies, named by that field's getter and setter.

This is the *entire* cost of adding a host to a composite one, and it asks the
host for nothing it does not already have — a host is written exactly as
`Host/StdIO.lean` and `Host/Random.lean` are written, and never mentions
registries, composition, or any other host.

The two lens laws are auto-params: for a record field they close by `rfl`, so a
call site writes only the projection and the update, and no `HostLens` is ever
named. -/

theorems each require `m.imports = thatHost.imports`; here the environment and
the spec are the same walk over `m.imports`, so they line up by construction
whatever the module declares — a subset, a different order, or a mixture of
several hosts. -/
