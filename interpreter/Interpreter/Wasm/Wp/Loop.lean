/-! ### Loop with a variant.

    The user supplies an invariant `Inv` and a `Nat`-valued measure `μ`. Each
    iteration must either exit (fallthrough or non-`br 0`) or re-enter with
    `Inv` re-established **and** `μ` strictly smaller. Termination is then
    automatic from well-foundedness of `<` on `Nat`; no fuel reasoning leaks
    into user proofs.

    Infinite loops are excluded: `[.loop 0 0 [.br 0]]` cannot satisfy `μ st' s' < μ st s`
    for any measure, so no instance of this rule applies. -/

/-- One-step unfolding of `exec` on a `.loop ps rs body :: rest` program.
The loop trims to `paramArity` on a `br 0` re-entry (the loop's
iteration carries `ps` values) and to `resultArity` on fall-through.
On a recursive `Break 0`, the inner `execOne` is invoked on the
trimmed stack and its result is plumbed through directly. -/
