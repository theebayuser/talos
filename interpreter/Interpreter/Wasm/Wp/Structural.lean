/-! ### The skeleton shared by the structural rules.

`block`, `loop` and `if` all reason the same way: run the body at one less
fuel, then react to the continuation the body produced. Everything fuel-shaped
in that argument is common to the three — the `OutOfFuel` split, the
`exec_fuel_mono` stabilisation, and the continuations the construct merely
forwards — so it is written here once, in `wp_of_body_dispatch`.

The reaction is deliberately *not* factored as a
`Continuation α → Continuation α` transformer: on fall-through a structured
construct re-enters `exec (fuel + 1) … rest`, so what it does with a
continuation depends on the fuel it was handed as well as on the continuation
itself. The three arms a construct interprets are therefore left as goals about
`wp m prog Q st s env`, with the body's stabilised behaviour supplied as a
hypothesis; a rule discharges them with `wp_of_eventually_eq` (control leaves
the construct and carries on with the rest of the program) or
`wp_of_eventually_const` (an outer break, which sheds one level and so is no
more the identity than the other two). -/

/-- The continuations a structured construct forwards unchanged.

`Fallthrough` and `Break` are the two a `block` / `loop` / `if` interprets;
every other continuation — traps, returns, `OutOfFuel` — passes straight
through, in the semantics and in the rule's postcondition alike. -/

/-- `wp` transported along an eventual agreement: if from `N` on, running
`prog` from `(st, s)` *is* running `prog'` from `(st', s')` at the same fuel,
then a `wp` for the latter is a `wp` for the former. This is what a structured
construct does once control has left it and the rest of the program takes
over. -/

/-- Fuel stabilisation of a body's `wp` — the `by_cases` / `exec_fuel_mono`
preamble every structural rule opens with.

Either the body diverges, in which case no fuel makes `exec` return and the
body's `wp` already records `Qb .OutOfFuel`; or `exec` on the body is pinned,
from some fuel on, to a single non-`OutOfFuel` continuation that `Qb`
describes. -/

/-- The body-dispatch step shared by `wp_block_cons`, `wp_iff_cons` and
`wp_loop_cons`.

`prog` runs `body` from `(st, sb)` at one less fuel and then reacts to the
continuation the body produced. This lemma does the fuel bookkeeping: it
stabilises the body and settles every continuation the construct forwards —
`hFwd` in the semantics, `hQFwd` in the postcondition, `OutOfFuel` included.

Three arms are left to the caller, one per continuation a structured construct
interprets: fall-through, `Break 0`, and `Break (k+1)`. Each is handed the fuel
`N` from which the body's result is pinned, and has to prove the rule's own
goal from it. -/
