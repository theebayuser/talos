/-! ### Block / if-then-else: structural, no measure required.

    Neither iterates; control either falls through, breaks out at level 0
    (exiting the construct), or propagates an outer break/return/trap. The
    rules are one-sided sufficient conditions — provide the body's `wp`
    against the right outcome continuation. -/
