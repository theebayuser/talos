/-! ### Atomic equations.

    `@[simp]` rewrite rules: when the head of the program matches a constructor,
    `wp` reduces structurally. Stack-consuming instructions reveal a
    `match s.values with ...` that `simp` reduces whenever the stack shape is
    concrete.

    Each lemma is discharged by the `wp_atomic` macro defined below, which
    unfolds `wp`, `exec`, and `execOne` and splits on the relevant `match`/`if`
    structure of the instruction. -/

/-- Solve a `wp` atomic-instruction goal whose RHS may contain `match`/`if`
    splits. Repeatedly opens splits and discharges the remaining leaves with
    the `exec`-unfolding helpers from `Defs.lean`. -/
