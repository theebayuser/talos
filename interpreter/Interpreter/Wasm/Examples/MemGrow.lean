/-! ## Example: memory.size / memory.grow

    Three sanity checks:

    1. `memory.size` returns the initial page count.
    2. `memory.grow delta` returns the *previous* page count and bumps
       `memory.size` by `delta` when the request is in range.
    3. Asking for more pages than the cap allows leaves the memory
       untouched and pushes `-1` (`0xFFFFFFFF`). -/

  .drop,
  .memorySize

/-- Try to grow far beyond `memoryHardCap` (65536 pages). Wasm specifies

    unchanged size, so the value stack ends as `[size, -1]` (top = size). -/

/-! ### Consumer of `run_pages_mono`

`growModule` has no imports and only the default memory, so `run_pages_mono`
applies. Unlike the `native_decide` checks above these hold for an *arbitrary*
initial store — it is the theorem, not computation, doing the work. -/

/-- Running the grow-then-size function never shrinks the memory, from any
starting store. -/
theorem grow_never_shrinks
    {st st' : Store Unit} {vs : List Value} {fuel : Nat}
    (h : run fuel growModule 1 st [] = .Success vs st') :
    st.mem.pages ≤ st'.mem.pages :=
  run_pages_mono (by decide) (by decide) h

/-- An in-bounds pointer stays in bounds across the call: the
`… ≤ pages * 65536` shape carried by the program specs is preserved. -/
theorem grow_preserves_bound
    {st st' : Store Unit} {vs : List Value} {fuel N : Nat}
    (hN : N ≤ st.mem.pages * 65536)
    (h : run fuel growModule 1 st [] = .Success vs st') :
    N ≤ st'.mem.pages * 65536 :=
  run_pages_bound_preserved (by decide) (by decide) hN h
