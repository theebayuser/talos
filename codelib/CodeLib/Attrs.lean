# `@[spec_of]` and `@[proves]` — load-bearing project attributes

These two attributes are the link between Lean specifications and the code
they describe, and between proofs and the specifications they discharge.
They carry the metadata that `verifier extract` reads off the source. The
runtime behavior here is intentionally minimal — the attribute machinery
only needs to *exist* so the source typechecks; semantics live in the
extractor.

## `@[spec_of <kind> "qualified::name"]`

Marks a `def Name : Prop := …` as a formal spec linked to a code symbol.
`<kind>` is one of:

* `rust-exported` — `target` is `crate::fn_name`, naming a wasm-exported
  Rust function (`#[unsafe(no_mangle)] pub extern "C" fn`).
* `rust-internal` — any other Rust path (`crate::module::fn`). Opaque to
  the extractor.
* `lean` — any Lean symbol. Opaque to the extractor.

A def may carry several `@[spec_of …]` attributes if it specifies more
than one symbol; each becomes a `Reference` in the extracted artifact.

## `@[proves SpecName]`

Marks a `theorem` as a verification of the named formal spec. `SpecName`
is the fully qualified name of a `@[spec_of …] def`. The theorem's stated
type is not required to be syntactically `SpecName` (a reformulation is
fine); the attribute is the source of truth for the link.

See `verifier/EXTRACT.md` (§P4, §P5, §P7) for the full discovery
contract.
