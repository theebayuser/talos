# NEAR host state (`α := NearState`)

The interpreter threads an opaque `host : α` slot through `Store α`; host
imports are the only code that inspects it. This module instantiates that
slot for the **NEAR Protocol** smart-contract host environment.

`NearState` is the part of the NEAR runtime a single contract call can
observe and mutate:

* `storage`   — the contract's storage trie, modelled as a *pure function*
  `key → Option value` (mirroring `Mem.bytes : Nat → UInt8`). This is the
  "projection of NEAR state" specs reason about before/after a call; the
  function model supports `∀ key` (frame) reasoning directly, and NEAR's
  storage-iterator host functions are deprecated so contracts can't
  enumerate keys anyway — only ghost specs do, via quantifiers.
* `registers` — the NEAR register ABI scratch buffers (`id → bytes`). Host
  functions that "return" variable-length data write it to a register; the
  contract then copies it into linear memory via `read_register`.
* `context`   — immutable call context (account ids, input bytes, deposit,
  and whether the call is a view call).
* `returnData` / `logs` — outputs produced via `value_return` / logging.
* `promiseResults` / `promises` — callback inputs and promise handles for
  proof-visible cross-contract APIs.
* `config`    — optional size limits that make unsupported oversize behavior
  trap instead of silently entering proofs.

Promise creation/action modelling is deliberately incremental: callback
result access and returned-promise selection are concrete; emitted receipt
actions are added in `Env.lean` as the host API grows.

The host-function semantics live in `CodeLib/Near/Env.lean`; this file is
just the state shape plus the pure helpers those functions are built from.

as an output `register_id`, the same value means "discard the output". -/
