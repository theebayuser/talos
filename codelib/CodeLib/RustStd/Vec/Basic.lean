# `CodeLib.RustStd.Vec.Basic`

A pure model of the safe `Vec<T>` surface, as a plain `List W`.

Like `CodeLib.RustStd.Option`, this is a spec-level model rather than a
wasm-level `_wp` lemma file.  Its consumer is `Project.RustVec.Spec`, which
states the contract of each `rust_vec` export in these terms.  Lemmas about
the model arrive with the first proof that needs them.

The model carries no capacity field.  Capacity is not observable through the
safe API: no safe method reads it back, and two vectors that differ only in
capacity answer every safe query identically.  The heap-level header, where
capacity is a real word, has its own model (`VecU8` in the merge-sort
formalization); this file is the spec-level counterpart and does not overlap
with it.

The model omits panic indexing (`v[i]`).  A panic compiles to a wasm trap, so
it is an outcome of the run rather than an operation of the data structure.
`get` is the total form that returns an `Option`, as `Vec::get` does.
