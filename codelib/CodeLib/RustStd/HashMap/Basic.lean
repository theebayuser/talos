# A pure model of the safe `HashMap` surface

An association list models `std::collections::HashMap`.  The list is
the *observable* content of the map: a key/value pair for each live entry.
The hash table, its buckets, its hash function and its capacity are all
absent, exactly as capacity is absent from the `Vec` model in
`CodeLib.RustStd.Vec.Basic`.

Two things the Rust type guarantees are carried explicitly rather than built
into the representation:

* **Key uniqueness** is the predicate `NodupKeys`, not a subtype invariant.  A
  bare `List (K × V)` keeps the model computable and keeps every lemma
  statement free of proof arguments.
* **Order is a property of the operations, not of the list.**  Nothing here
  forces the list into an order, so a model map and a Rust map with the same
  entries are the same value whatever order the list arrived in.  A `HashMap`
  has no specified iteration order, so the wire cannot use that order.  The
  encoder sorts the entries by key instead, which gives one byte string for
  one map.  `sortByKey` is that step, and `CodeLib.RustStd.HashMap.Codec`
  builds the encoding on it.

Every lookup below compares keys with `BEq`.  The model reads that comparison
as equality, so each lemma that looks a key up takes `[LawfulBEq K]`.

Like `CodeLib.RustStd.Vec.Basic`, this file is a spec-level model rather than
a wasm-level `_wp` lemma file.  Its consumer is `Project.RustHashMap.Spec`,
which states the contract of each `rust_hash_map` export in these terms.
Lemmas arrive with the first proof that needs them: `ofEntries_eq_self_of_nodup`,
`sortByKey_perm` and `nodupKeys_sortByKey` serve the wire round trip in
`CodeLib.RustStd.HashMap.Codec`, and `get_sortByKey` serves the contract that
reads it back.  `nodupKeys_insert`, `nodupKeys_ofEntries` and `nodupKeys_remove`
discharge the key-uniqueness hypothesis those lemmas take, for the map an export
decodes rather than for an arbitrary list; without them a reader can state the
round trip but cannot apply it.  The algebra of `insert` and `remove` against
`get` waits for a proof that needs it.  `pairwise_sortByKey` is the one
exception to that rule: it has no consumer, and it says what the sort is for.

namespace Wasm.RustStd.HashMap

variable {K V : Type}

/-- The observable content of a map: one pair per live entry. -/
abbrev Map (K V : Type) := List (K × V)

/-- Every key occurs at most once. -/
def NodupKeys (m : Map K V) : Prop := (m.map Prod.fst).Nodup

/-- The value stored under `key`, if any. -/
def get [BEq K] (m : Map K V) (key : K) : Option V :=
  (m.find? (fun entry => entry.1 == key)).map Prod.snd

/-- Whether `key` has a live entry. -/
def containsKey [BEq K] (m : Map K V) (key : K) : Bool :=
  (m.find? (fun entry => entry.1 == key)).isSome

/-- The number of live entries. -/
def len (m : Map K V) : Nat := m.length

/-- `HashMap::insert`: replace the value under `key` in place when the key is
present, otherwise append a new entry.  Returns the displaced value alongside
the updated map, matching the Rust return type `Option<V>`.

Replacement is in place, so `insert` never reorders live entries.  That is a
property of this model.  A Rust `HashMap` offers no order at all, and
`sortByKey` is where the two agree. -/
def insert [BEq K] (m : Map K V) (key : K) (value : V) : Option V × Map K V :=
  match m.find? (fun entry => entry.1 == key) with
  | none => (none, m ++ [(key, value)])
  | some old =>
      (some old.2,
        m.map (fun entry => if entry.1 == key then (key, value) else entry))

/-- `HashMap::remove`: drop the entry under `key` and return its value.

The filter drops every entry whose key matches, while the returned value is
the first match.  The two agree on any map with `NodupKeys`, which is what
`nodupKeys_ofEntries` gives for the map an export decodes. -/
def remove [BEq K] (m : Map K V) (key : K) : Option V × Map K V :=
  (get m key, m.filter (fun entry => !(entry.1 == key)))

/-- `HashMap::from_iter`, which is what `collect::<HashMap<_, _>>()` calls:
insert each entry in turn, so a later value under a key already seen replaces
the earlier one.  The result therefore has one entry per *distinct* key, and
is shorter than `entries` whenever a key repeats.

A driver does this operation when it reads a map off the wire, so
it is what stands between `CodeLib.RustStd.HashMap.Codec` (which decodes a
list of pairs, duplicates and all) and the map the contracts talk about. -/
def ofEntries [BEq K] (entries : List (K × V)) : Map K V :=
  entries.foldl (fun m entry => (insert m entry.1 entry.2).2) []

/-- The entries reordered by the key ordering the caller supplies.  A `HashMap`
has no order of its own, so the encoder picks one and sorts the entries by key.
That is the one order a serialized map can show.  The sort of a map whose keys
do not repeat is a permutation that no operation here observes. -/
def sortByKey [LE K] [DecidableRel (α := K) (· ≤ ·)] (m : Map K V) : Map K V :=
  m.mergeSort (fun a b => decide (a.1 ≤ b.1))

/-- The sort only reorders the entries.

and the length bound of the entry codec, and `get_sortByKey` below. -/

/-- The sort puts the entries in key order.

This one pins the definition rather than serving a later proof.  Nothing else
here observes the order.  `sortByKey` could reorder by anything, or not at all,
and every other lemma in this file would still hold.  The contracts in
`Project.RustHashMap.Spec` do observe it.  They name the exact bytes an export
writes, and `sort_unstable_by_key` in the Rust crate writes them. -/

The wire format carries the count in a `u32` header, so every lemma about the

can move that count, which is what lets a caller carry the bound it already
has across an operation instead of a new proof. -/
