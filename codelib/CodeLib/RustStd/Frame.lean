# `CodeLib.RustStd.Frame`

Foundational reasoning helpers for Rust functions compiled to wasm at
`opt-level = 0` (the corpus convention; see `programs/rust/Cargo.toml`).

At `-O0`, LLVM gives every function a stack frame and **spills results
through linear memory** before returning them. So *every* opt-0 spec proof
pushes a value through a `store`/`load` round-trip and has to show the
frame access stays in bounds. The lemmas here discharge that once, in a
form that does not care about the concrete spill address:

* `Mem.read{32,64}_write{32,64}_same` — read-after-write at the same
  address returns the value (no bound on the address needed).
* `Mem.write{32,64}_pages` — a store leaves the page count unchanged.
* `Mem.read{32,64}_write{32,64}_disjoint` — a read is unaffected by a
  write to a disjoint byte range, in every width combination, built on
  the byte-level `Mem.write{32,64}_bytes_of_disjoint`. Proofs that juggle
  several frame slots (argument spills vs. scratch vs. result) need these
  to carry a value across the unrelated stores in between.

The in-bounds (no-trap) obligation also needs `sp - 16` not to underflow;
that is `UInt32.toNat_sub_of_le`, which Lean core already provides
(`Init.Data.UInt.Lemmas`), so it is used directly rather than re-proved here.

The unconditional `_same`/`_pages` lemmas are intentionally global `@[simp]`
— confluent, terminating rewrites used corpus-wide. The `_disjoint` family
is deliberately **not** `@[simp]`: each rewrite carries a disjointness side
condition, so proofs name these lemmas explicitly (in a `simp only` set or
a `rw`) and discharge the side goal with `decide` / `omega` on the concrete
frame addresses. Op-specific lemmas (e.g. `popcnt` bounds) are added here
only once a real proof first consumes them.

A write only touches the bytes inside its footprint. These are the

/-! ## Disjoint read/write framing

A read is unaffected by a write to a disjoint byte range, in all four
width combinations of the opt-0 corpus (`read{32,64}` × `write{32,64}`).
The disjointness hypothesis puts one footprint entirely before the other,
stated on `.toNat` so that `decide` / `omega` closes it when the frame
addresses are concrete. -/
