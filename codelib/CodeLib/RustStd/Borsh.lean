# The borsh wire format

[borsh](https://borsh.io/) is the serialization format the `rust_vec` exports
use on both sides of the byte stream.  Its specification is short, and the
part these programs need is five rules:

* an unsigned integer is its little-endian bytes, with no framing;
* a `bool` is one byte, `0` or `1`;
* `Option` is a tag byte, `0` for `None` and `1` followed by the payload for
  `Some`;
* a dynamic container is a `u32` little-endian length, then the elements;
* a tuple or struct is its fields in order, with nothing between them, so a
  tuple needs no definition here: write `++`.

Every one of those is already expressible with what `CodeLib` has, so this
module adds no new machinery.  It gives the layouts their borsh names, so a
contract can say "this export writes a borsh `Option<u32>`" instead of
restating the tag convention at each use.  The names are the borsh type names
and the namespace is for qualified use: `Borsh.u32`, `Borsh.option`,
`Borsh.vec`.  `vec` is literally `Wasm.RustStd.Vec.serialize`: the
length-prefixed format that module already defines *is* the borsh container
encoding, which is why the round trip below is `Vec.deserialize_serialize`
under another name.

Five definitions and one inherited round-trip theorem.  Consumer:
`Project.RustVec.Spec`, which states one contract per `rust_vec` export in
these terms.
