# Talos

[![Lean](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lean-v4.30.0-blue?logo=lean)](lean-toolchain)

**Talos** is a WebAssembly interpreter written in Lean 4, named after the bronze giant of Greek mythology who guarded Crete — a mechanical guardian, built to enforce rules.

The same definitions that _execute_ a Wasm program are the ones you _reason about_. There is no separate spec interpreter to keep in sync: evaluation and proof share a single codebase.

> **Work in progress.** Talos is under active development. APIs and proof interfaces may change.

## What this is

The goal is a **feature-complete, executable semantics for WebAssembly** that doubles as a formal object. You can:

- Run programs on concrete inputs.
- State and prove theorems about their behavior — correctness against a spec, equivalence between programs, properties that hold for all inputs — using Lean's proof tooling.

The interpreter is deliberately optimized for **clarity of reasoning over execution speed**. Talos aims for full Wasm coverage, but the immediate focus is on the subset of features that arise naturally from non-optimized, higher-level source code (Rust, C, etc.) — the semantics that actually matter when you want to verify what a program _does_, not how fast it does it.

Proof is the north star. Performance work belongs behind a separately proven-equivalent implementation.

## Reasoning foundation

Proofs in Talos are built on **weakest precondition (WP) calculus** — a [predicate transformer semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_transformer_semantics) that lets you reason backwards from postconditions to the preconditions that guarantee them. This gives structured, compositional proofs for loops, branches, and function calls without re-unfolding the interpreter at every step.

## Quick start

**Run a `.wat` module:**

```
cd interpreter
lake exe runner samples/factorial.wat fact 5
```

Output: `120`

**Run with a fuel cap** (default 1 000 000 steps):

```
lake exe runner --fuel 10000 samples/factorial.wat fact 5
```

See [`interpreter/samples/factorial.wat`](interpreter/samples/factorial.wat) for a minimal example module.

**Prove something about it:**

[`interpreter/Interpreter/Wasm/Examples/Factorial.lean`](interpreter/Interpreter/Wasm/Examples/Factorial.lean) shows a complete correctness proof using the WP tactic layer.

## Repository layout

Three Lake packages in a monorepo, forming a strict dependency chain:

| Package | Path | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| `Interpreter` | `interpreter/` | Wasm AST, semantics, WP tactic layer |
| `CodeLib` | `codelib/` | Lifting lemmas and program-reasoning helpers |
| `Programs` | `programs/` | Concrete Rust-to-Wasm verification tasks |

## Using as a dependency

**Depend on the interpreter only** (Wasm semantics + WP calculus):

```toml
# lakefile.toml
[[require]]
name = "WasmInterpreterLean"
scope = "your-org"           # if published, or use path/git
path = "path/to/repo/interpreter"
```

**Depend on CodeLib** (adds lifting lemmas and reasoning helpers on top):

```toml
[[require]]
name = "CodeLib"
path = "path/to/repo/codelib"
```

Code that imports `CodeLib` never needs to import the interpreter directly —
`CodeLib` re-exports the parts of the interpreter that downstream proofs need.

## Building

```bash
just build   # builds interpreter → codelib → programs in order
```

Or build a single package:

```bash
cd interpreter && lake build
cd codelib     && lake build
cd programs    && lake build
```

Dependencies:

- **Lean 4** — toolchain pinned in `interpreter/lean-toolchain`, fetched automatically by [`elan`](https://github.com/leanprover/elan).
- **[`wasm-tools`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools)** — needed to decode `.wasm` binaries and to run the Wasm testsuite. `brew install wasm-tools` or `cargo install wasm-tools`.

## Running the Wasm testsuite

```bash
just testsuite
```

Filter to a specific file by name:

```bash
just testsuite i32
```
